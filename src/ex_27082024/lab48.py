#create dir - normal folder ->python doesnot search the files here or code here

#python is very smart, folder with file __int__.py python will search code here

#__init__.py ->if u add this directory converted to module where python will search better


# diff between normal created dir and python package dir which contains __init__.py which is invoked by pycharm.
