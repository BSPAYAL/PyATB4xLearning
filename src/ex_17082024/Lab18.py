#Types of Operator
# Assignment -> = which is used to store right value to the left value .
how_many_lambo_pramod = -1 #Unary operator

#Arithmetic operators
# +,-,*,/

#divmod ->does division and modulus
# x//y ->prints the quotient
print(4//2) #2
# x%y ->gives remainder
print(4%2) #0
# x**y -> power 4 to the power 2
print(4**2) #16

# == -> compares left value with right value and returns boolean value

#Not operator is used with boolean
is_pramod_married = True
print(not is_pramod_married) #returns False

#Logical Operator returns boolean value
# >,<,<=,>=

#AND,OR ,NOT(generally used in integers) GATE
x =10
y =20
print(x!=y) #not operator
#10 not equal to 20

#Ternary operator
